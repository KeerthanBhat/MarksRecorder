# MarksRecorder
Simple **C** application to track your Semester marks using **files** concept.

A dashboard will be displayed which allows the user to select either Add, Modify, Delete or List marks of all courses. I have 
followed the marking scheme and structure used in RVCE, Bangalore.
Essentially the user has to enter all the internal marks and the marks to be obtained for different grades will be displayed.
Attendance requirements will also be accounted.

I did this as a project after the introductory course, Programming in C in my undergraduate first sem.
